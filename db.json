up in a small town in upstate New York. The town was originally founded by a group of freed slaves who had escaped from the south and sought refuge in the north. The town was very close-knit, and everyone knew everyone else. The author's childhood was relatively happy and uneventful.\n\nThe author's parents were both college professors, and they always encouraged their children to pursue their passions. The author developed a love for writing early on, and his parents were always supportive of his creative endeavors.\n\nThe author moved away from home at the age of 18 to attend college. He eventually settled in Boston, where he has been living for the past 10 years.\n\n#  What were some early jobs of the author?\n\nThe author's first job was working as a cashier at a grocery store. He then worked as a waiter in a restaurant. He also worked as a website developer, and most recently he has been working as an online teacher.\n\n#  When and where was the book published?\n\nAccording to WorldCat, the book was published in 2015 by The MIT Press.\n\n#  What are some themes of the book?\n\nThe book has many themes that are interconnected. One such theme is the idea of perspective and how it shapes one's outlook on life. Perspectives are constantly shifting throughout the novel, and this causes characters to evaluate their beliefs and actions. Another key theme is the danger of obsession. Characters in the novel become consumed by their passions, which often leads to destructive outcomes. Lastly, the book addresses the complexities of family relationships. It explores the various ways in which families can be dysfunctional and how individuals interact within them.","source":"_posts/What-is-the-name-of-the-author.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is the name of the author\ndate: 2022-09-06 19:12:44\ncategories:\n- Cafe\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What is the name of the author?\n\nThe author's name is unknown.\n\n#  Where did the author grow up?\n\nThe author grew up in a small town in upstate New York.
