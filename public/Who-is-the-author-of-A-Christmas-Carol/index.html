The story tells of Ebenezer Scrooge’s journey from mean-spirited miser to warm-hearted friend of the poor.</p>
<p>The novella has been adapted for stage, television, opera, and film many times since its publication. It has been credited with renewing interest in the Christmas season and has been praised for its message of redemption and hope.</p>
<p>Charles Dickens was born on February 7, 1812, in Portsmouth, England. He was one of eight children and his father was a clerk in the Naval Pay Office. When Charles was twelve years old, his father was sent to prison for debt and the family was forced to go into exile in France.</p>
<p>Dickens worked as a law clerk and journalist before becoming a novelist. His novels include Oliver Twist (1837–39), A Tale of Two Cities (1859), and Great Expectations (1861). He also wrote short stories and essays and he frequently spoke out against social injustice.</p>
<p>Dickens died on June 9, 1870, after collapsing from a stroke while walking at home.</p>

It was announced in October 2008, and released on December 9, 2009 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. The game is based on the 1843 novella of the same name by Charles Dickens.</p>
<p>Development of the game took just four months, with a team of nine people. The game’s art director, Matt James, drew inspiration from Geppetto creator Stefan Gagne’s animation work as well as Rankin&#x2F;Bass Productions’ stop motion Christmas specials such as Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964) and Frosty the Snowman (1969). One goal was to make the environments look like paintings.</p>
<p>The game was generally well received by critics. The majority praised the visuals, music and humor, but found the puzzles to be too easy. A Christmas Carol was nominated for Best Adventure Game at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, but lost to Heavy Rain.</p>
