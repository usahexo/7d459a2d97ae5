#  Travel to Bermuda for an unparalleled blackjack experience that will raise your prestige like never before!

Known as the birthplace of aviation, Bermuda is a stunning island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. When you're not exploring the multitude of historical attractions and natural wonders that this territory has to offer, you'll find no shortage of high-quality casinos where you can try your luck at blackjack.

Unlike other jurisdictions where the game is played with eight decks of cards, Bermuda casinos typically use six decks. This results in a decidedly different playing experience that can be advantageous for savvy players. The reduced number of decks also decreases the house edge, making it a more favourable place to gamble for those who are looking for an edge over the casino.

In addition to great blackjack games, Bermuda offers superb weather, beautiful scenery, and world-class resorts. You'll never want to leave!
