#  Dodgers-Cubs series a betting bonanza

The Los Angeles Dodgers and Chicago Cubs are set to square off in a highly anticipated National League Championship Series. The Dodgers finished the regular season with the best record in baseball, while the upstart Cubs overcame a 3-1 deficit in the divisional series against the San Francisco Giants to advance.

Las Vegas has made the Dodgers heavy favorites to win the series, but there is plenty of interest from bettors on both sides. “It’s been crazy,” said Jimmy Vaccaro of the South Point hotel sports book. “We’ve had more tickets written on this series than any I can remember in years.”

That interest is reflected in the betting odds, which have seen the Cubs move from longshots to 12-5 underdogs as of Monday morning. Bettors believe that there is value on Chicago, which should not be taken lightly after its performance against the Giants.

The Dodgers opened as 150-point favorites, but that number has come down with so much action on Chicago. The OVER/UNDER for total games has also seen significant movement, with 3-2 now being the most popular choice.

There is no clear favorite in this series, and it should be a lot of fun to watch. Look for plenty of fireworks as these two teams battle for a chance to go to the World Series.

#  Clemson favored by 1.5 points over Alabama in the National Championship

The Clemson Tigers will take on the Alabama Crimson Tide in the National Championship game on Monday, January 7th. The game is scheduled to start at 8:00 PM EST and will be televised on ESPN.

The Clemson Tigers are coming into this game as a 1.5 point favorite. They finished the season with a 12-1 record and their only loss came against Syracuse. The Clemson offense is led by quarterback Trevor Lawrence who threw for 3,280 yards and 36 touchdowns this season. The Clemson defense is led by defensive end Clelin Ferrell who had 19 sacks this season.

The Alabama Crimson Tide finished the season with a 13-0 record. Their only win came against Louisiana State University. The Alabama offense is led by quarterback Tua Tagovailoa who threw for 3,839 yards and 43 touchdowns this season. The Alabama defense is led by defensive end Raekwon Davis who had eight sacks this season.

This should be a very close game, but I think the Clemson Tigers will come out on top and win by a score of 27-24.

#  Packers favored by 1.5 against the Cowboys

In what is likely to be one of the most anticipated games of the year, the Green Bay Packers are favored by 1.5 points over the Dallas Cowboys. This game is shaping up to be a shootout, with both teams sporting high-powered offenses.

Rodgers and the Packers come into this game off a big win against the Falcons, while Dak Prescott and the Cowboys narrowly escaped with a victory against the Bengals. Prescott will need to continue playing at a high level if Dallas wants to upset Green Bay on their home turf.

The Cowboys are coming into this game relatively healthy, with only Tyron Smith listed as questionable. The Packers, on the other hand, have several players that are dealing with injuries, including Rodgers himself. If Rodgers is unable to play or is limited in any way, it could be difficult for Green Bay to pull out a win.

Despite being favored in this game, the Packers are not going to have an easy time defeating Dallas. The Cowboys have been one of the most surprising teams in the NFL this season, and they will definitely be looking to pull off an upset this weekend.

#  Cavaliers open as 1.5 point favorites against the Warriors

The Golden State Warriors have been the dominant force in the NBA for the last few years, but they will face a tough test in the first round of the playoffs this year. The Cleveland Cavaliers are opening as 1.5 point favorites against the Warriors,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) and there is good reason for that.

The Warriors have been dealing with some key injuries recently. Klay Thompson has been out since March 11th with a torn ACL, and Kevin Durant is also sidelined with a calf injury. While Thompson is expected to miss the entire playoffs, Durant is hoping to return in time for the first round.

Even with Thompson and Durant in the lineup, the Warriors are not as strong as they have been in past years. They finished the regular season with a record of 58-24, which was their worst record since 2013-14. The Cavaliers, on the other hand, finished with a record of 50-32, which was only good enough for third place in the East.

Despite their record, the Cavaliers are still a very dangerous team. LeBron James has had another MVP-caliber season, and he will be looking to lead his team to another championship. The Warriors may be able to win if Durant returns from injury and is able to play at a high level, but they are definitely not favored in this series.

#  Spurs are pedestrian 1.5 point favorites against the Rockets

The San Antonio Spurs are now 1.5 point favorites against the Houston Rockets after opening as 2 point underdogs. The Rockets have been on a tear recently, but the Spurs have looked more pedestrian lately.

Houston is coming off of a blowout victory over the Golden State Warriors, while the Spurs narrowly beat the Orlando Magic. The Rockets are -7 in average margin of victory in their last 10 games, while the Spurs are only -3 in their last 10 games.

The Rockets are certainly a good team, but the Spurs should be able to win this game at home.
