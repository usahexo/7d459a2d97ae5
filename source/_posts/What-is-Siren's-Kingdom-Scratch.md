#  What is Siren's Kingdom Scratch?

Siren's Kingdom Scratch is a programming language that enables kids to create stories, games and animations. It was created in 2013 by Karen Wilkinson and Mitchel Resnick from the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. The main goal of the language is to help kids learn to think creatively, reason systematically and work collaboratively.

# How Does Siren's Kingdom Scratch Work?

Siren's Kingdom Scratch works by using 'blocks' that snap together like LEGO bricks. These blocks represent different commands that kids can use to create their stories, games and animations. There are blocks for writing code, running code, importing graphics, playing sounds and more.

Kids can use blocks to create sequences of commands which will make their stories, games or animations run. They can also use comments to write notes about what they're doing in their code. This makes it easy for them to keep track of their ideas and troubleshoot any problems they may encounter.

The best thing about Siren's Kingdom Scratch is that it's really easy to use. Kids don't need to know how to read or write code in order to start creating things with it. They just need to be able to drag and drop blocks into sequences and click on the run button.

# Who Can Use Siren's Kingdom Scratch?
