#  Paris Saint-Germain scores late in stoppage time to beat Borussia Dortmund in Champions League

In a thrilling Champions League matchup at the Westfalenstadion, Paris Saint-Germain eked out a win over Borussia Dortmund in stoppage time.

PSG was the dominant team for most of the match, but Dortmund was able to keep things close with some opportunistic plays. In the end, it was substitute Kylian Mbappé who scored the winner in the 96th minute to give PSG the 3–2 victory.

Dortmund started brightly and had several chances in the opening minutes, but it was PSG who took the lead in the 27th minute. Neymar played a beautiful ball over the top of the defense to Marco Verratti, and Verratti calmly slotted it past Roman Bürki.

PSG doubled their lead just before halftime when Dani Alves’ whipped cross found Edinson Cavani at the back post, and Cavani headed it home.

The second half was more even, with both teams creating chances but failing to score. But with just seconds remaining in stoppage time, Mbappé collected a long ball from Marquinhos and beat Bürki one-on-one to give PSG all three points.

It was an exciting match that showcased some of Europe’s best young players. Mbappé and Neymar were both brilliant for PSG, while Christian Pulisic showed glimpses of his tremendous potential for Dortmund. With this win, PSG extend their lead atop Group F to five points.

#  Neymar scores twice as Paris Saint-Germain beats Angers SCO 3-0

PARIS (Reuters) - Neymar continued his superb form by scoring twice as Paris Saint-Germain beat Angers SCO 3-0 on Wednesday to provisionally move top of Ligue 1.

The world’s most expensive player, who has now scored 10 goals in eight appearances for the French champions this season, opened the scoring midway through the first half with a volley from close range.

He then doubled PSG’s lead after the break with another composed finish and substitute Kylian Mbappe completed the victory in injury time.

"The team is progressing well, we are winning and we are creating chances," said Neymar. "We are doing our job and I am very happy."

Neymar has now scored 33 goals in all competitions since joining PSG from Barcelona in August for a world record 222 million euros ($263 million).

With champions Monaco losing 2-1 at Strasbourg earlier on Wednesday, PSG moved two points clear at the top of the table.

#  Giovani Lo Celso double leads Paris Saint-Germain to victory over Amiens SC

Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Giovani Lo Celso netted twice as the reigning Ligue 1 champions eased to a 3-0 victory over Amiens SC at the Parc des Princes on Friday evening.

The result moves PSG up to second in the table, two points behind league leaders Olympique Lyonnais, with Lo Celso also taking his goal tally for the season up to four.

PSG manager Thomas Tuchel made three changes to the side that disappointingly drew 2-2 away at Strasbourg last time out, with Lo Celso, Christopher Nkunku and Kylian Mbappé all coming into the starting XI.

And it was Lo Celso who opened the scoring midway through the first half, poking home from close range after Neymar’s low cross had been parried into his path by goalkeeper Regis Gurtner.

Ten minutes later, it was 2-0 as Mbappé collected Marquinhos’ pass before delicately chipping over Gurtner for his eighth goal of the season.

The hosts continued to dominate after the break and it was no surprise when they added a third goal in the 71st minute, Lo Celso again on target this time volleying in from 12 yards after being teed up by Angel Di Maria.

#  Kylian Mbappe scores hat-trick as Paris Saint-Germain thrash Monaco 7-1

In what was billed as a potential title decider, Kylian Mbappe stole the show as he scored a hat-trick in Paris Saint-Germain’s 7-1 demolition of Monaco.

The result leaves PSG four points clear at the top of Ligue 1 with nine games remaining, and it seems increasingly likely that they will be crowned champions for a fifth consecutive season.

Mbappe got the ball rolling in the sixth minute with a close-range finish and he added a second ten minutes later with an opportunistic effort.

The 19-year-old completed his hat-trick in the second half with two well-taken goals, and there were also strikes from Neymar, Julian Draxler and Edinson Cavani as Monaco were ruthlessly massacred.

This result is likely to heap further pressure on Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim, whose side have now lost six of their last seven games in all competitions.

#  Angel Di Maria fired up for Champions League match against former club Manchester United

Angel Di Maria is determined to help Paris Saint-Germain inflict a Champions League final heartache on his former club Manchester United.

Di Maria was sold by United for £59.7 million in the summer of 2014, just 12 months after he joined from Real Madrid for a British-record £59.1m fee.

The Argentine has had mixed fortunes since leaving Old Trafford, but he is now aiming to help PSG win the Champions League for the first time in their history.

"I want to win this Champions League because it would be a very important step for the club," Di Maria said. "It's always a special competition and this year we have our chance to do something great."

Asked if he had any particular motivation to beat United, Di Maria replied: "Obviously, yes. It will be a special match against my former club. But I want to win it for PSG, not against United."


When Angel Di Maria departed Manchester United after one season, many were surprised that the winger did not settle into life at one of Europe's biggest clubs. After all, he had starred at Real Madrid and was being signed by then manager Louis van Gaal - an individual with an excellent pedigree in developing players.

However, things quickly turned sour for the player at Old Trafford and he was eventually sold to Paris Saint-Germain for £60 million after scoring just three goals in 32 appearances for the Red Devils. Fast forward three years and with Manchester United out of the Champions League and Paris Saint-Germain looking like genuine contenders to lift the trophy, it is easy to forget how things panned out for Di Maria in England.
