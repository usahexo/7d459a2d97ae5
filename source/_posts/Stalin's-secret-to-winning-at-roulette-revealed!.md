#  Roulette tips from the master himself: Stalin's guide to winning big

1. When playing roulette, always bet on black.

2. Never bet on a single number – this is a sure way to lose your money.

3. Make sure you spread your bets around different numbers, so that if one number doesn't come up, you still have a chance of winning.

4. If you're feeling lucky, you can bet on two numbers at once by placing your chips on the edge between the two numbers.

5. A common strategy is to place your bets on the opposite colours (red and black, or even and odd). This way, you have a 50/50 chance of winning your bet.

6. Another strategy is to bet on a group of numbers (e.g. 1-12 or 13-24). This gives you a higher chance of winning, but the payouts are usually lower.

7. In order to maximise your chances of winning, change your bets regularly – don't keep betting on the same number over and over again!

#  Follow Stalin's simple tips for 20p roulette and rake in the cash!

Stalin was a master of gambling, and his tips will help you win big at the roulette table. Follow these simple rules to make sure you come out on top every time:

1. Bet on black. This is the safest option, as the odds are evens that black will come up.

2. Stick to low numbers. The odds are higher that a number between 1 and 18 will come up than a number between 19 and 36, so choose wisely.

3. Place your bets early. This increases your chances of winning, as other players may not have had time to place their bets yet.

4. Be patient. Don't rush into making decisions – make sure you're confident about your choices before betting your money.

5. Keep track of the wheel's momentum. If the ball has been slowing down as it approaches the final few slots, bet on the opposite of where it's likely to end up. Likewise, if the ball is flying round fast, bet on the same colour as where it's most likely to land.

6. Use systems like Fibonacci and Labouchere to increase your profits. These systems can be tricky to understand at first, but they're well worth learning if you want to maximise your earnings from roulette!
