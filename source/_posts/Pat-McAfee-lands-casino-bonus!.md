The casino is expected to benefit from an influx of new players, many of whom will no doubt be fans of McAfee. His involvement will also help to raise awareness of the casino among potential customers.

It was a banner day for Indianapolis Colts punter Pat McAfee, who announced a new endorsement deal with a Las Vegas casino. The bonus offer from the casino is said to be in the $250,000 range. This comes on the heels of McAfee signing a new four-year contract with the Colts worth over $14 million.

There's no doubt that McAfee is one of the top young punters in the NFL, and this new deal reflects that. Indianapolis is surely glad to have him locked up long-term, and casinos are likely to compete for his endorsement services in the future. It will be interesting to see if any other NFL players follow suit and sign deals with casinos.

Punters are often overlooked by fans and the media, but McAfee is quickly becoming one of the most exciting players on the Colts. He has a powerful leg and is capable of flipping the field with his kicks. He's also very good at handling kickoffs, which is an important part of the game that often goes unnoticed.

McAfee should continue to be one of the top players at his position for years to come, and it's great to see him getting rewarded for his hard work.
