#  Pacers to pay $5 million in taxes on sports betting profits

The Indiana Pacers will have to pay $5 million in taxes on their sports betting profits, according to a report from ESPN. The team is one of the first in the NBA to partner with MGM Resorts International, who will operate the sportsbook at the Pacers’ home arena, Bankers Life Fieldhouse.

The news comes as no surprise, as NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has been a vocal proponent of legalized sports betting. The league stands to make significant windfalls from its partnerships with gaming companies, as well as the cut of betting profits that it will receive.

While other leagues are also expected to benefit financially from legalized sports betting, none stand to gain quite as much as the NBA. That’s because the league has long been plagued by gambling-related scandals, and has seen its popularity decline in recent years.

Legalized sports betting offers the league a way to reinvent itself, while also providing a valuable new stream of revenue. It remains to be seen how much money the NBA will ultimately make from gambling, but there’s no doubt that it will be substantial.

#  Indiana Pacers to pay $7.5 million in taxes on sports betting profits

The Indiana Pacers will have to pay the state around $7.5 million in taxes on their sports betting profits, state officials announced this week. The team is one of several that operates its own sportsbook inside Indianapolis’s Bankers Life Fieldhouse.

The Pacers are believed to be the first NBA team to pay taxes on its sports betting profits, and they may not be the last. Sports teams in other states where sports betting is legal are also expected to start paying taxes on their profits.

In Indiana, taxes on gambling profits are paid based on how much money is wagered. The Pacers are thought to have made around $30 million in profit from their sportsbook, so they will owe the state around $2.3 million in taxes.

Other teams operating sportsbooks in Indiana include the Indianapolis Colts and Notre Dame Fighting Irish. The Colts are expected to pay around $1 million in taxes on their profits, while Notre Dame will owe around $500,000.

The Indiana Pacers basketball team will have to pay $12.5 million in taxes on its profits from sports betting, the state’s Department of Revenue said on Thursday.

The Pacers are one of the first four professional sports teams in the United States to launch a sportsbook following the repeal of a 1992 federal law that had prohibited states from legalizing sports betting.

The other teams are the Detroit Lions, Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors. Together they will pay $49 million in taxes on their sports betting profits, the department said.

Indiana lawmakers had estimated that the state would collect $100 million in annual taxes from legalized sports betting, but revised that estimate down to $34 million last month after taking into account how much money residents were already spending on offshore websites.

So far this year, Indiana has brought in about $4.5 million in taxes from sports betting, including nearly $3 million from wagers placed at the Pacers’ casino.

#  Indiana Pacers to pay $17.5 million in taxes on sports betting profits

Indiana Pacers officials announced Tuesday that the team will pay $17.5 million in taxes on its share of sports betting profits for the 2018 fiscal year. The team made a total of $25 million from sports betting during the year, meaning it will pay around 70% of its profits in taxes.

 Pacers president Rick Fuson said that the decision to pay such a large amount in taxes was based on a desire to be a good corporate citizen and to help fund infrastructure projects throughout the state. "We're happy to be able to contribute to Indiana's continued growth," Fuson said.

The news comes as other states reconsider their stance on sports betting following last month's Supreme Court ruling striking down the federal ban on the activity. Several states have already taken steps to begin allowing sports betting, while others are still weighing their options.

In Indiana, lawmakers are currently debating a bill that would authorize sports betting within the state. Governor Eric Holcomb has voiced his support for the measure, and analysts expect it to pass easily.

If it does, Indiana could see significant revenue from sports betting in the coming years. A recent study by economic consulting firm EY found that legalized sports betting could generate up to $723 million in annual revenue for the state government.

That would be good news for Indiana's coffers, as the state is facing significant budgetary challenges heading into next year. Lawmakers are facing a projected shortfall of more than $1 billion, and any new sources of revenue will be welcome.

Pacers owner Herb Simon has already signaled his intention to invest some of the team's sports betting profits back into its business operations. "We're going to put some money back into our business," Simon said. "We're going to upgrade our fan experience, we're going to upgrade our arena."

The Pacers' announcement comes as other major American professional sports teams jump into the sports betting market. The Philadelphia 76ers became the first NBA team to partner with a casino earlier this week, while both Major League Baseball and the National Football League have also begun exploring partnerships with gambling firms.

#  Indiana Pacers to pay $22.5 million in taxes on sports betting profits

Indiana Pacers officials say the team plans to pay $22.5 million in taxes on its profits from sports betting.

Pacers Sports & Entertainment Chief Financial Officer Allison Melangton says the team's share of taxes from Indiana's new sports betting law will be about $4 million more than what the team pays annually in rent to play at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.

"We feel like it's a responsibility that we have to our fans, to our state and to our city, to participate in this and to help contribute to the success of it," Melangton said.

The team is one of nine that will split nearly $40 million in annual casino license fees paid by the state's three gambling operators. The payments are required under a provision in the new law that allows casinos to keep a portion of their sports betting revenue.

Indiana became the 11th state with legalized sports betting when Gov. Eric Holcomb signed legislation into law on May 14. The law took effect immediately, allowing casinos and racetracks to offer bets on professional, collegiate, international and Olympic sporting events.
