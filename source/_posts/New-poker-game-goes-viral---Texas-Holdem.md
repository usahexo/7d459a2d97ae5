#  Zynga launches Texas Holdem Poker on Facebook

Zynga Poker, one of the most popular online poker games, has just released their Texas Holdem Poker game on Facebook. Texas Holdem Poker is a card game that pits players against each other in a battle of wits, strategy and luck. The basic premise is to bet what you can afford to lose against other players in order to win the pot.

Texas Holdem Poker is one of the most popular variants of poker and can be found in almost every casino in the world. The game was originally invented by American poker player Doyle Brunson and has since grown into a hugely popular pastime. The game is usually played with two or more people, but can also be played as heads-up (against one opponent).

In Texas Holdem Poker, each player is dealt two cards face down (hole cards), followed by the first three shared community cards (the flop). These are placed in the middle of the table for all players to see. Each player then has a choice to either fold (give up) or bet. If you decide to bet, you must put in an amount at least equal to the previous bet or raise. After all players have either folded or put in their bets, a fourth community card (the turn) is placed on the table. Players now have another opportunity to bet. The fifth and final community card (the river) is then placed on the table and players once again have an opportunity to bet (this time, for their final hand).

The best five-card hand wins the pot. In Texas Holdem Poker, there are only seven possible combinations of poker hands (see below), ranking from high to low:

1) Royal flush: A royal flush is composed of 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace of the same suit. This is the best possible hand and can only be won when playing against another royal flush.

2) Straight flush: A straight flush is composed of five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g. 9♣ 10♣ J♣ Q♣ K♣). This is a very powerful hand and can beat any other type of hand except for a royal flush or four of a kind.

3) Four of a kind: Four of a kind occurs when you are dealt four cards of the same rank (e.g 4♥ 4♦ 4♠ 4♣). This beats any other combination excluding a straight flush or royal flush.

4) Full house: A full house consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank (e.g 3♥ 3♦ 6♥ 6♦). This hand beats both two pairs and two singles, but loses out to four of a kind or better.

5) Flush: A flush occurs when all five cards are from the same suit but not consecutive (e.g A♦ 2♥ 7♦ 10♥ J♦). This hand beats any single pair but loses out to any higher ranked combination such as three-of-a-kind, straight or full house etc.).

6) Straight: A straight occurs when five consecutive cards are not all from the same suit (e.g 2♦ 3♣ 4♦ 5♠ 6♣). This hand beats any two pairs but loses out to any higher ranked combination such as three-of-a-kind or full house etc.).

7) Two pairs:Two pairs simply means that you have two different pairs in your five card hand (e..g Q♥ Q♦ 7♥ 7♦). This hand ties with any other two pair combinations and loses out to all other hands except for one pair or ace high
