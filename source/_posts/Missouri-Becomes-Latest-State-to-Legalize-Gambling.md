#  Missouri Becomes Latest State to Legalize Gambling

On Wednesday, November 7th, 2018, Missouri voters went to the polls to decide on a number of statewide propositions, including one to legalize gambling. The proposition passed with 54% of the vote, making Missouri the latest state to legalize some form of gambling.

The bill authorizes four types of gaming - casino games, poker, lotteries, and betting on horse races. It will also allow for the construction of new casinos in Missouri. Existing casinos will be able to offer new games, such as craps and roulette.

Supporters of the measure say it will create jobs and generate revenue for the state. Opponents argue that it will lead to more gambling addiction and social problems.

Missouri is now the fourth US state to legalize online poker, joining Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware.

#  Missouri Governor Signs Bill Legalizing Gambling

On Wednesday, Missouri Governor Mike Parson signed a bill legalizing gambling in the state of Missouri. The new law will allow for both online and brick and mortar casinos, as well as sports betting.

Prior to this week's vote, Missouri was one of only five states in the US without any form of legalized gambling. The passing of the bill is expected to bring in an extra $180 million in tax revenue each year.

Some lawmakers and casino operators have expressed concern that the new law may not be enough to compete with neighboring states such as Iowa and Illinois, which have already legalized gambling. However, others are optimistic that the new law will help create jobs and spur economic growth in the state.

Governor Parson issued a statement following the signing of the bill, saying "This is a historic day for Missouri, as we expand gaming opportunities in our state and provide much-needed revenue to our schools, roads and rural communities."

Missouri is now the latest US state to legalize gambling, following in the footsteps of Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware.

#  Missouri Slots Parlors Soon to be Legal

The Missouri General Assembly has approved a measure that would legalize casino-style gambling in the state. The new bill would allow for the establishment of up to 13 “slots parlors”, which would offer electronic versions of traditional casino games like blackjack, poker, and slots.

Proponents of the measure say that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state, which is facing significant budgetary shortfalls. According to estimates from the Missouri Department of Revenue, the new casinos could generate as much as $200 million per year in tax revenue.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to increased crime and gambling addiction. They also maintain that it will siphon business away from existing casinos in neighboring states.

The bill now goes to Governor Jay Nixon for his signature. If he signs it into law, the first slots parlors could be open by early 2017.

#  New Missouri Gambling Laws Include Poker Tournaments

The new Missouri gambling laws, which go into effect at the end of the month, include a section on poker tournaments. This is good news for poker players in the state, as it provides a clear legal framework for organizing and running poker tournaments.

Prior to the passage of these new laws, there was some uncertainty about whether poker tournaments were legal in Missouri. This ambiguity created some problems for tournament organizers, who were reluctant to run events in case they ran afoul of the law. Now that there is a clear legal framework in place, tournament organizers can proceed with confidence that their events will be legal.

The new Missouri gambling laws provide a number of protections for poker players. For example, they make it clear that players cannot be arrested or prosecuted for participating in a poker tournament. They also provide immunity from civil suits for players who participate in tournaments organized in accordance with the law.

This is good news for Missouri poker players, who now have a safe and legal way to enjoy their favorite game. Thanks to the new gambling laws, Missouri is now one of the most player-friendly states in the country when it comes to poker tournaments.
